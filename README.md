# Clerk viewers and utils to plan bikepacking events

This repository contains extensions and custom viewers for Clojure's
[Clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk), designed to help bike
tourists and ultra-cyclists to plan multi-day routes.

Traditional tools ([Komoot](https://komoot.com/),
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/),
[Cycle.travel](https://cycle.travel/), and so onâ€¦) focus on planning
the route itself, in some cases (Komoot) providing extra tools to
divide the route into multiple same-length days.

`rando-planner` assumes the user already have a GPX track defined
(provided for example by the organizers of a bike event), and let the
user plan the daily effort to a higher granularity.

After a data structure called _plan_ is defined, `rando-planner`
provides different types of visualization that can be used to study
different strategies to cover the distance.

The visualizations include:

- A map visualization (based on Leaflet) of the route, with markers
  corresponding to the location reached after each day is completed.
- A schematic diagram of the plan, showing the running count of
  kilometers, the corresponding elevation reached at each moment, when
  scheduled pauses will happen, when the Sun rises and sets (_WIP_),
  and the total amount of kilometers accumulated every day

## Usage

At the moment, in order to use this code, you have to clone this
repository and add a new notebook in the `notebooks` folder.  You can
use all Clerk features plus those provided by `rando-planner`.

### Defining a plan

```clojure
(def plan-start-19
  {:description "Starting on April 19th"
   :gpx gpx-resource
   :average-speed average-speed
   :daily-plans [{:label "Day 1"
                  :date "2024-04-19"
                  :activities [{:start "15:00" :length 6 :type :ride}]}
                 {:label "Day 2"
                  :date "2024-04-20"
                  :activities [{:start "07:00" :length 5 :type :ride}
                               {:start "17:00" :length 3 :type :ride}]}
                 {:label "Day 3"
                  :date "2024-04-21"
                  :activities [{:start "08:00" :length 6 :type :ride}]}]})
```
