;; ## Notes and planning

;; I'm considering the Short Lake route,
;; consisting in a total of 400 kilometers.

;; The route does not show particularly challenging climbs.

;; I think I can maintain an average speed of 20 km/h
;; (this quantity ought to be further decreased because of how
;; I use the parameter, that is it includes time I spend in short pauses
;; to take pictures, consult the map, eat, and stuff like thatâ€¦)

;; ### Scenari

;; The first scenario starts in the afternoon of the first day.
;; Pedaling until dark then find a place for the night.
;; The second day is the largest effort.
